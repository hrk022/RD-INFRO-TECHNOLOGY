### Description:
- This model predicts whether a customer will exit a bank based on their details, including credit score, age, balance, etc.
Context
This dataset contains information about customers of a U.S. bank and is designed to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn). It focuses on key numerical and categorical factors that influence customer retention, helping banks to take proactive measures to minimize churn.

Content
The dataset includes the following details for each customer:

Credit Score: A numerical representation of the customer's creditworthiness.
Geography: Country of residence.
Age: Age of the customer.
Balance: The balance maintained in the account.
Number of Products: Number of bank products the customer uses.
Has Credit Card: Indicates if the customer owns a credit card (Yes/No).
Is Active Member: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (Yes/No).
Estimated Salary: The customer's estimated annual salary.
Exited: Indicates whether the customer left the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
Acknowledgements
This dataset originates from a U.S. bank and provides valuable insights for developing predictive models in the banking sector.

Inspiration
This dataset is perfect for beginners to practice predictive modeling and learn to use various machine learning libraries. By working on this dataset, you can gain hands-on experience in building models that address real-world challenges in customer retention.
